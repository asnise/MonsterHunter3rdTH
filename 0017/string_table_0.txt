Bipedal creatures resembling cats,<NEWLINE>known for their light hair. Though<NEWLINE>usually docile, they will attack<NEWLINE>viciously if provoked. Naturally<NEWLINE>curious, some try to enter human<NEWLINE>society. Fond of Felvine, they<NEWLINE>will follow its scent anywhere.
Bipedal creatures resembling cats,<NEWLINE>known for their dark hair. More<NEWLINE>curious than Felynes and possessed<NEWLINE>by kleptomania, Melynxes take what<NEWLINE>they can steal back to their dens.<NEWLINE>Felvine intoxicates them, causing<NEWLINE>them to sometimes drop items.
Insects that inhabit many areas.<NEWLINE>Noted for absorbing fruit, mush-<NEWLINE>rooms, and honey, then carrying<NEWLINE>them back to their nest. Materials<NEWLINE>can thus be collected from their<NEWLINE>swollen abdomens, whose color is<NEWLINE>related to what is being carried.
Flying insects that inhabit most<NEWLINE>environments. They attack invaders<NEWLINE>with a paralyzing venom and lay<NEWLINE>eggs in carrion together with a<NEWLINE>fluid that hastens decomposition.<NEWLINE>As their bodies are fragile, use<NEWLINE>poison for harvesting their parts.
Carnivorous monsters that inhabit<NEWLINE>deserts. Delex always travel in<NEWLINE>schools of five or six. When near<NEWLINE>large monsters on a hunt, they<NEWLINE>attempt to surround the prey and<NEWLINE>scavenge food. Known to flee if<NEWLINE>other Delex are injured.
Herbivorous, deer-like monsters.<NEWLINE>Valued for their horns, they tend<NEWLINE>to run away at the first hint of<NEWLINE>danger. They are also hunted for<NEWLINE>their meat, which is chewy but<NEWLINE>flavorful.
Relatively docile herbivores with<NEWLINE>characteristic crest plates. They<NEWLINE>form herds and raise young commun-<NEWLINE>ally, and have been used as pack<NEWLINE>animals for generations; their<NEWLINE>meat is tasty and nutritious. Very<NEWLINE>cautious around large monsters.
Extremely territorial herbivores<NEWLINE>with poor vision but acute<NEWLINE>hearing. Rhenoplos will doggedly<NEWLINE>pursue any nearby targets they<NEWLINE>sense.
Herbivores that live near water in<NEWLINE>the Volcano and Flooded Forest.<NEWLINE>Their heavy hides store nutrients,<NEWLINE>and are prized for their resistance<NEWLINE>to heat and water. Males are quite<NEWLINE>territorial, often refusing to flee<NEWLINE>even from invading wyverns.
Herbivores that live in cold<NEWLINE>climates. Generally docile, though<NEWLINE>they attack when threatened. Their<NEWLINE>high-quality pelts have many uses,<NEWLINE>and their antlers are highly<NEWLINE>prized by the Guild. Simply stun<NEWLINE>the creatures to harvest one.<NEWLINE>
Herd-forming herbivores. Covered<NEWLINE>in thick fur to endure the cold.<NEWLINE>Popo are gentle, but known to use<NEWLINE>their massive tusks bravely when<NEWLINE>defending their young. Popo meat<NEWLINE>is very nutritious; the tongue is<NEWLINE>said to be especially palatable.
Flightless bird wyverns with<NEWLINE>vestigial wings. They can often be<NEWLINE>found roaming wild in the Misty<NEWLINE>Peaks, but are also raised as<NEWLINE>livestock in Yukumo Village. Quite<NEWLINE>timid, Gargwa have been known to<NEWLINE>lay eggs when startled.
Highly social, carnivorous bird<NEWLINE>wyverns that live in large packs.<NEWLINE>Young Jaggi males hunt in groups<NEWLINE>when attacking larger animals, and<NEWLINE>have been known to steal wyvern<NEWLINE>eggs. Research suggest they act<NEWLINE>under orders from an alpha male.
Female Jaggi that stay in groups,<NEWLINE>Jaggia generally cluster around<NEWLINE>the nest to defend it and raise<NEWLINE>whelps. Smaller than mature males,<NEWLINE>but larger than and tougher than<NEWLINE>the countless young males.
The commanding alpha male of Jaggi<NEWLINE>packs. Most males leave the group<NEWLINE>upon reaching maturity, returning<NEWLINE>to compete with others. The<NEWLINE>dominant male then becomes a Great<NEWLINE>Jaggi. Apparently, they can issue<NEWLINE>fairly complex orders via howling.
Highly intelligent, carnivorous<NEWLINE>Bird Wyverns that hunt in packs.<NEWLINE>Noted for their blue scales and<NEWLINE>sharp glare. Baggi are feared for<NEWLINE>their ability to release a<NEWLINE>tranquilizing fluid; it can knock<NEWLINE>out even humans.
Carnivorous bird wyverns like the<NEWLINE>Jaggi. Noted for their projecting<NEWLINE>cranial crests and bluish-white<NEWLINE>skin that's adapted to snow. Great<NEWLINE>Baggi craftily command other Baggi<NEWLINE>to surround their prey and stun<NEWLINE>them with a tranquilizing fluid.
Small, carnivorous bird wyverns<NEWLINE>with poison-generating organs.<NEWLINE>They run in packs, often led by a<NEWLINE>large alpha male. Lesser members<NEWLINE>of the order are fiercely loyal,<NEWLINE>and will eagerly lay down their<NEWLINE>lives to protect the alpha.
Bird wyverns that spit a poisonous<NEWLINE>mist. Wroggi travel in packs that<NEWLINE>are led by the largest and most<NEWLINE>toxic member. The poison is made<NEWLINE>in a sac-like organ around its<NEWLINE>throat; if destroyed, the wyvern's<NEWLINE>ability to spit is impaired.
Bird Wyverns with unique plumage.<NEWLINE>Well known for using their<NEWLINE>thoracic vocal organs to imitate<NEWLINE>other monsters' calls, first<NEWLINE>summoning them, then using the<NEWLINE>distraction to flee. Spits a<NEWLINE>dangerous combustible body fluid.
A subspecies of Qurupeco with<NEWLINE>vivid crimson plumage and the same<NEWLINE>aptitude for mimicry and dance.<NEWLINE>Flints in their wings allow them<NEWLINE>to generate electricity, which can<NEWLINE>be discharged as either shocking<NEWLINE>jolts or intense flashes of light.
A large wild boar. Foul tempered,<NEWLINE>they will charge hunters on sight.<NEWLINE>They are aggressive and powerful,<NEWLINE>so beware! They are often hunted<NEWLINE>for their meat, which many<NEWLINE>hunters find delicious.
The powerful leader of the wild<NEWLINE>boars known for its enormous<NEWLINE>tusks. More aggressive than a<NEWLINE>Bullfango, it is known to rush<NEWLINE>into a fight, and is extremely<NEWLINE>proficient at locating a foe.
Forest- and mountain-dwelling<NEWLINE>beasts found in humid regions.<NEWLINE>Though known more for fishing and<NEWLINE>standing upright to collect honey,<NEWLINE>their thick claws and heavy<NEWLINE>forearm plating allow them to deal<NEWLINE>powerful blows to any aggressor.
Fanged beasts whose warm pelts and<NEWLINE>thick layers of fat help them to<NEWLINE>survive in harsh colder climates.<NEWLINE>Though mainly herbivores, Lagombi<NEWLINE>occasionally make use of their<NEWLINE>exceptional hearing and ability to<NEWLINE>glide on ice to sneak up on prey.
Fanged beasts with thick, red<NEWLINE>carapaces resistant to lava. Their<NEWLINE>rounded bodies are perfect for<NEWLINE>rolling across hot surfaces, and<NEWLINE>their long tongues are ideal for<NEWLINE>capturing insect prey. Their<NEWLINE>saliva emits a paralyzing toxin.
Barroth usually remain beneath the<NEWLINE>mud, perhaps to shield themselves<NEWLINE>from heat; they are even known to<NEWLINE>attack by flinging mud. They will<NEWLINE>charge in a frenzy at anything<NEWLINE>that disturbs their bogs.
A subspecies of Barroth found in<NEWLINE>colder climates. Lacking mud, they<NEWLINE>coat themselves with snow and ice,<NEWLINE>which can be flung at threats.<NEWLINE>They are known for bashing their<NEWLINE>overgrown crowns into the ice, and<NEWLINE>subsist primarily on Bnahabra.
Brute wyverns that feed on ore,<NEWLINE>using their mighty jaws to crush<NEWLINE>bedrock into powder. They cleverly<NEWLINE>affix rock and ore to themselves<NEWLINE>with lava, then spread them about,<NEWLINE>using vibrations to make them<NEWLINE>explode.
A metallic subspecies of Uragaan<NEWLINE>with an unusual diet that allows<NEWLINE>it to create a powerful, noxious<NEWLINE>gas. The gas permeates the rocks<NEWLINE>on its body, which then emit foul<NEWLINE>fumes when scattered. Like regular<NEWLINE>Uragaan, they can roll to travel.
Giant brute wyverns with hammer-<NEWLINE>like growths on their tails. They<NEWLINE>subsist on fallen or withered<NEWLINE>trees, often using their tails to<NEWLINE>knock said trees over. Researchers<NEWLINE>speculate that the lumps on their<NEWLINE>backs act as an energy source.
The dreaded, nomadic Deviljho have<NEWLINE>no specific territory of their own<NEWLINE>Their muscles swell if provoked,<NEWLINE>revealing old wounds. Needing to<NEWLINE>feed constantly due to high<NEWLINE>body heat, they can hunt nearby<NEWLINE>animals to extinction.
Aquatic female monsters. Ludroth<NEWLINE>form "harems" around large males,<NEWLINE>hence gathering in territories<NEWLINE>designated as breeding grounds.<NEWLINE>They are known to be extremely<NEWLINE>aggressive towards outsiders;<NEWLINE>caution is advised.
Royal Ludroth use their sponge<NEWLINE>like neck scales to absorb water<NEWLINE>and prevent drying out on land.<NEWLINE>Once the sponge loses moisture,<NEWLINE>they attempt to re-enter the<NEWLINE>water. They also spew mucus to<NEWLINE>trip up their prey.
A Royal Ludroth subspecies with a<NEWLINE>spongy purple mane that can both<NEWLINE>store and disperse a powerful<NEWLINE>toxin. Moistening this mane seems<NEWLINE>to revitalize the creature, so it<NEWLINE>prefers to reside in watery areas.
Leviathan species that live in the<NEWLINE>Sandy Plains. Known to lurk in the<NEWLINE>sand, they mimic sand dunes to<NEWLINE>catch unsuspecting prey. They can<NEWLINE>produce wind tunnels.
Leviathans that inhabit volcanoes.<NEWLINE>Noted for swarming around larger<NEWLINE>monsters' kills in order to feed.<NEWLINE>Uroktor rarely hunt for themselves<NEWLINE>but stab upward at prey from the<NEWLINE>ground when they do. Known for<NEWLINE>being highly aggressive.
Also known as fire-pike wyverns,<NEWLINE>Agnaktor use their tough beaks and<NEWLINE>great strength to burrow through<NEWLINE>rock. However, their hardened-lava<NEWLINE>armor becomes soft when they<NEWLINE>burrow underground or are attacked<NEWLINE>with fire or explosives.
A Tundra-based subspecies of<NEWLINE>Agnaktor that spits powerful jets<NEWLINE>of water. Its sharp beak allows it<NEWLINE>to burrow into the permafrost and<NEWLINE>clad itself in a layer of ice.<NEWLINE>This icy armor can only be melted<NEWLINE>with heat-based attacks.
Fire-breathing female wyverns,<NEWLINE>also known as the "Queens of the<NEWLINE>Land". With powerful legs and<NEWLINE>poison-secreting tails, they hunt<NEWLINE>mainly on the ground. Sometimes<NEWLINE>seen preying as a couple, Rathian<NEWLINE>cooperate well with Rathalos.
A rare variant of Rathian with a<NEWLINE>beautiful golden body reminiscent<NEWLINE>of the moon. Little is known about<NEWLINE>their behavior or physiology--<NEWLINE>including the source of their rich<NEWLINE>golden sheen.
Terrible wyverns called the 'Kings<NEWLINE>of the Skies'. Together with<NEWLINE>Rathian, they stake wide territor-<NEWLINE>ies centered around their nests.<NEWLINE>Rathalos descend on invaders from<NEWLINE>the sky, attacking with poison<NEWLINE>claws and breath of fire.
A rare variant of Rathalos with a<NEWLINE>beautiful silver body reminiscent<NEWLINE>of the sun. Little is known about<NEWLINE>their behavior or physiology--<NEWLINE>including the source of their rich<NEWLINE>silver sheen.
Wyvern larvae. Reasonably fecund,<NEWLINE>they can survive in any dark<NEWLINE>environment. Giggi are sensitive<NEWLINE>to light and heat, and so avoid<NEWLINE>torches. They are also known to<NEWLINE>leech from other animals,<NEWLINE>converting it into toxins.
Wyverns that inhabit the Tundra.<NEWLINE>Gigginox live in darkness and thus<NEWLINE>have degraded vision; they detect<NEWLINE>prey via body heat, then attack<NEWLINE>with poison. When excited, their<NEWLINE>color changes and parts of their<NEWLINE>body harden. Extremely fertile.
A subspecies of Gigginox that uses<NEWLINE>electricity to stun prey. It is<NEWLINE>believed to be a random mutation,<NEWLINE>and as such, sightings are rather<NEWLINE>rare. It may be possible to weaken<NEWLINE>its electrical powers by breaking<NEWLINE>the capacitor organs on its body.
Wyverns that rule the eternally<NEWLINE>frozen Tundra. Barioth use their<NEWLINE>huge tusks and spiked scales to<NEWLINE>move freely atop the slippery ice;<NEWLINE>this ability makes them very<NEWLINE>difficult to keep up with.
A Barioth subspecies that resides<NEWLINE>in the Sandy Plains. Their breath<NEWLINE>is strong enough to generate<NEWLINE>tornadoes, which they then use to<NEWLINE>travel at high speeds. Their<NEWLINE>yellow carapaces are tinted red,<NEWLINE>and their fangs shine deep blue.
Flying wyverns that have evolved<NEWLINE>to live in thickly wooded areas.<NEWLINE>These sly beasts stalk their prey<NEWLINE>from the shadows with ferocious<NEWLINE>speed and dogged tenacity, and<NEWLINE>their massive tails are as<NEWLINE>dexterous as they are deadly.
A Nargacuga subspecies with<NEWLINE>mottled fur that allows it to<NEWLINE>blend into the foliage of verdant<NEWLINE>areas like the Flooded Forest and<NEWLINE>the Deserted Island. It is skilled<NEWLINE>in the use of its tail, the spikes<NEWLINE>of which are extremely deadly.
Two-horned wyverns found in desert<NEWLINE>zones. They are capable of<NEWLINE>burrowing into sand to attack prey<NEWLINE>from below. Incredibly violent and<NEWLINE>proud, they are known to unleash<NEWLINE>terrible wrath when accosted.
These black-shelled Diablos are<NEWLINE>treated as a subspecies, but are<NEWLINE>actually just normal female<NEWLINE>Diablos in heat. The color change<NEWLINE>is a warning to other creatures,<NEWLINE>as they tend to become extremely<NEWLINE>aggressive during mating season.
A flying wyvern that maintains its<NEWLINE>primitive origins. Prone to<NEWLINE>violence, it possesses incredible<NEWLINE>ferocity thanks to its four limbs,<NEWLINE>claws, and jaws. Inhabits a wide<NEWLINE>area, it has even been spotted<NEWLINE>hunting Popo in the mountains.
Tigrex subspecies with very<NEWLINE>violent and aggressive behavior.<NEWLINE>Their limbs are developed for<NEWLINE>charging. They are feared by many<NEWLINE>for their powerful jaws and<NEWLINE>striking claws.
A wyvern truly wrapped in mystery.<NEWLINE>Known to some as the black god and<NEWLINE>to others as the tyrant of fire,<NEWLINE>this large and brutal creature is<NEWLINE>known to the Guild simply as<NEWLINE>Akantor...
A mysterious wyvern. Known locally<NEWLINE>by some as the White God, although<NEWLINE>the Guild refers to it as the<NEWLINE>Avalanche Wyvern, for it crushes<NEWLINE>rock and gorges through ice.
Fanged wyverns whose bodies are<NEWLINE>streaked with electricity. Sharp<NEWLINE>claws and strong limbs allow them<NEWLINE>to thrive in mountainous terrain.<NEWLINE>During hunts, they gather numerous<NEWLINE>Thunderbugs to boost their power<NEWLINE>and enter a supercharged state.
Rare ore can be mined from these<NEWLINE>enormous dragons' backs; thus they<NEWLINE>are considered prosperity symbols.<NEWLINE>They swallow vast amounts of<NEWLINE>organic material and are always<NEWLINE>surrounded by scavenging Delex,<NEWLINE>which sailors use to locate them.
Deep within the Misty Peaks,<NEWLINE>an Elder Dragon descends onto the<NEWLINE>Mountain Summit. It appears as the<NEWLINE>personification of a large storm<NEWLINE>and its appearance has become a<NEWLINE>Yukumo Village tradition.
Blazing black dragons, so named<NEWLINE>for resembling both lightning and<NEWLINE>darkness. They mercilessly tear<NEWLINE>apart whoever touches their sharp<NEWLINE>scales. Elementally unstable,<NEWLINE>their actions can affect the very<NEWLINE>weather. Living natural disasters.
